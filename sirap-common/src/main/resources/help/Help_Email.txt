A>@                execute command A then a mail with the result could be sent to configured receiver
A>$@               with dollar symbol, the result would be parsed as files and attached to the email
A>k@g.cn           execute command A then a mail with the result could be sent to fire@g.cn
A>k@g.cn[;m@z.cn]  multiple receivers separated by semi-colons are perfectly acceptable                    
A>@,Hello          the mail will be with a subject 'Hello', same goes for specified receiver
mc                 display email configuration

x HelloWorld       x command, send an email to default receiver, simple subject&content
x F:\A.txt         though it is a normal file, we treat it as a simple text string
x $F:\B.txt        the normal filename starts with a $ symbol, we treat it as a file
x $$F:\C.txt       the normal text filename starts with two $ symbols, that indicates that we are going
                   to deal with the content of this text file, which could be the content of the email,
                   further more we will parse each line in the content, if the given line indicates a 
                   normal file then it could be attached to the email if no target specified                   
x F:\fire          it is a folder, but we treat it as a simple text string
x $F:\fire         the folder name starts with a $ symbol, we deal with the normal files in it
x stuff>@,Hello    the mail will be with a subject 'Hello', same goes for specified receiver
x ABC;F:\A.txt;$F:\B.txt;$$F:\C.txt  combination stuff separated by semi-colons in x-command
