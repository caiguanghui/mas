41 Psalm 
11 Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wickedor stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers,
2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.
3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in seasonand whose leaf does not wither¡ª whatever they do prospers. 
4 Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 
6 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
